# Plan: Expense Tracker MVP (Telegram bot + FastAPI backend)

Companion to the project context doc (CLAUDE.md). This file is the work
plan: units, acceptance criteria, ordering, model routing.
Workflow per unit: /clear → /unit <id> docs/plans/expense-tracker-mvp.md
→ Stop-gate (verify.sh) → [reviewer for risky units] → human commits.

## Goal
Working family expense tracker: Telegram bot UI over an HTTP-only FastAPI
backend, permissions enforced per the two-level model, budget threshold
notifications on expense creation.

## Non-goals (V1)
Voice input, Mini App, self-registration, OAuth/JWT, scheduled digest jobs
(APScheduler removed from V1 scope — see Decision log).

## Constraints
- Architecture rules from project CLAUDE.md are law (layering, async, no ORM,
  money as BIGINT minor units, Base/Create/Update/Response).
- Bot ↔ backend only via HTTP with X-Telegram-User-Id + X-Internal-Token.
- Contracts (M0 models) are immutable for later units; changes go through
  this file's Decision log first.

## Milestone M0 — Foundation & contracts

- [x] **U0.1 Skeleton**: config.py (pydantic-settings incl. INTERNAL_TOKEN),
      database.py (asyncpg pool, init/close/get_connection), main.py app
      factory with lifespan, GET /health.
      AC: app boots; /health returns 200 in a test with pool mocked/test DB.
      Model: sonnet.
- [x] **U0.2 Contracts — all Pydantic models** (user, expense, category, tag,
      budget_plan, permission) in the 4-schema pattern; shared enums
      (Role, Resource, Action); typed domain errors (NotFoundError,
      PermissionDeniedError, LimitExceeded warning type).
      AC: mypy green; import-and-instantiate tests pass; expense.category_id
      REQUIRED (decision D2).
      Model: sonnet. ⚠ Human-review this diff — it locks the architecture.
- [x] **U0.3 Initial migration**: full schema + indexes
      expenses(account_id, created_at), expenses(category_id),
      expense_tags(tag_id); categories.id referenced with ON DELETE RESTRICT.
      AC: alembic upgrade head on a clean DB, then downgrade base, both clean.
      Model: sonnet (mechanical — haiku acceptable).
- [x] **U0.4 Test infrastructure**: conftest.py — async httpx client fixture,
      test-DB fixture with per-test transaction rollback, factory helpers
      (make_user/make_expense).
      AC: one dummy repo-less test and one DB round-trip test pass;
      pytest markers registered.
      Model: sonnet.

## Milestone M1 — Data layer (repositories)

- [x] **U1.1 BaseRepository[T] + user_repo**.
      AC: generic CRUD integration tests via test DB (create/get/update/delete).
- [x] **U1.2 category_repo + tag_repo**.
      AC: CRUD tests + unique-per-account behavior documented in tests.
- [x] **U1.3 expense_repo** incl. expense_tags junction handling,
      get_by_period, get_by_category, sum_by_category_month.
      AC: aggregation tests on seeded fixture data (known sums, month
      boundaries, timezone-safe created_at filtering).
- [x] **U1.4 budget_plan_repo + check_limit** → returns fill percent
      computed in SQL from BIGINT sums (no float money math).
      AC: parametrized tests — no plan, 0%, exactly threshold, >100%.
      RISKY → reviewer subagent.
- [x] **U1.5 permission_repo**.
      AC: CRUD + UNIQUE(user_id, resource) conflict test.
Model for M1: sonnet throughout.

## Milestone M2 — Auth, permissions, services, API

- [x] **U2.1 deps.py: get_current_user + PermissionChecker** implementing the
      6-step enforcement order from CLAUDE.md, plus X-Internal-Token check
      (decision D1).
      AC: parametrized test grid over the full default matrix
      (3 roles × 4 resources × 4 actions) + own_only cases + override-row
      cases + viewer-cannot-be-overridden case + missing/bad token → 401.
      MOST COMPLEX LOGIC IN PROJECT → /effort high, reviewer subagent,
      human reads the diff.
- [x] **U2.2 users: service + API** (admin-only CRUD).
      AC: route tests incl. member/viewer → 403.
- [x] **U2.3 categories + tags: services + API**.
      AC: HTTP CRUD tests; RESTRICT delete returns clean 409 with message.
- [x] **U2.4 expenses: service (CRUD only, no notification yet) + API**.
      AC: create/list/update/delete via HTTP; own_only enforced (member
      can't update someone else's expense); tag attach/detach works.
- [x] **U2.5 budgets: budget_service (progress calc — pure logic) + API**.
      AC: progress/summary math in parametrized unit tests (int math only).
- [x] **U2.6 statistics_service + API**.
      AC: by-period / by-category / by-tag aggregates match seeded data.
Model for M2: sonnet; U2.1 with /effort high.

## Milestone M3 — Business logic wiring

- [x] **U3.1 notification_service + trigger in ExpenseService.create**.
      Send via httpx to Bot API; failure MUST NOT fail expense creation
      (decision D3): wrap in try/except with logged error.
      AC: fake transport tests — threshold crossed → message sent exactly
      once; below threshold → nothing; transport error → expense still
      created, error logged.
      RISKY → reviewer subagent.

## Milestone M4 — Bot

- [x] **U4.1 client.py + middlewares**: httpx wrapper (all API calls),
      allowlist middleware, header injection (tg_id + internal token).
      AC: unit tests with mocked transport (respx); non-allowlisted tg_id
      is dropped before any API call.
- [x] **U4.2 Bot skeleton**: bot.py dispatcher, states.py, keyboards.py.
      AC: dispatcher builds; keyboards render expected callback_data.
      Model: haiku-friendly (boilerplate).
- [x] **U4.3 handlers/expenses — FSM add-expense flow**
      (category → amount → optional comment/tag → confirm) + list view.
      AC: FSM walkthrough test with fake API client: happy path, cancel
      mid-flow, invalid amount input re-prompts. Amount parsed to minor
      units in ONE helper with its own tests (comma/dot, "1 234,56").
      Largest bot unit — split list view into U4.3b if diff exceeds budget.
- [x] **U4.3b handlers/expenses — list view** (split from U4.3, D39):
      `/expenses` command rendering the account's expenses from
      `client.list_expenses()`, minor-units formatted for display.
      AC: rendering tests against a fake API client — non-empty list,
      empty list, comment shown when present.
- [x] **U4.3a Docker packaging (local + prod compose)** — infra unit, no
      Python changes (design locked in D40):
      1. `Dockerfile` — multi-stage, `python:3.13-slim` + uv (`uv sync
         --frozen --no-dev` in a builder stage, copy the venv into a slim
         runtime stage, non-root user). ONE image for both services; the
         compose files pick the command (`uvicorn main:app` vs
         `python -m bot.bot`).
      2. `.dockerignore` — MUST exclude `.env*` (config.py reads `.env`;
         secrets must never bake into the image), plus `.git`, `.venv`,
         `__pycache__`, `tests/`, `docs/plans/`.
      3. `docker-compose.yml` (local laptop testing): `db` (postgres:16,
         named volume, `pg_isready` healthcheck) → `migrate` (one-shot
         `alembic upgrade head`, runs to completion) → `api` (port 8000
         published, `/health` healthcheck) → `bot` (starts after api
         healthy). `DATABASE_URL`/`BACKEND_BASE_URL` overridden in the
         compose file (`db`/`api` service hostnames); everything else from
         `env_file: .env`.
      4. `docker-compose.prod.yml` (AWS, from master): NO `db` service —
         `DATABASE_URL` points at Supabase (session pooler, port 5432, NOT
         the transaction pooler — asyncpg prepared statements, see Risks;
         if pgbouncer errors appear set `statement_cache_size=0`).
         `migrate` + `api` + `bot` only, `restart: unless-stopped`,
         NO published ports (bot long-polls outward; api is reached only
         via the internal compose network).
      5. Root `CLAUDE.md` Commands section gains the docker run commands.
      AC: `docker compose build` clean; `docker compose up` on a clean
      checkout → migrations apply to fresh Postgres, `curl
      localhost:8000/health` → 200, bot container logs "Starting bot
      polling"; `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml config`
      validates; verify.sh untouched and green (config-only diff).
      Note: D18's greenlet gap does NOT apply inside Linux containers
      (`platform_machine` reports `aarch64`/`x86_64`, so greenlet installs
      and real Alembic migrations work — no `psql SCHEMA.sql` workaround).
      Model: sonnet.
- [x] **U4.4 handlers/categories** (split from "categories + tags", D43):
      list/add/rename/delete flows against fake API; permission-denied from
      API rendered as a human message, not a stack trace.
- [x] **U4.4b handlers/tags** (split from U4.4, D43): mechanical mirror of
      U4.4 for tags — list/add/rename/delete against fake API,
      permission-denied rendered as a human message.
- [x] **U4.5 handlers/budgets + statistics rendering**.
      AC: rendering tests on fixed API responses (progress bars, totals
      formatted from minor units).
Model for M4: sonnet; repetitive handler/keyboard parts → haiku.

## Milestone M5 — Smoke

- [ ] **U5.1 e2e smoke (@integration)**: bot client → real API → test DB:
      add expense → appears in list → budget threshold notification fired.
      AC: scenario green on test DB; run excluded from default verify.sh
      (integration marker).

## Milestone M6 — Deployment (CD)

- [ ] **U6.1 CD flow: GitHub Actions → GHCR → EC2** (design locked in D42;
      only hard prerequisite is U4.3a, but sequenced after M5 so the
      pipeline only ever auto-deploys a smoke-tested master):
      1. `docker-compose.prod.yml`: the three services change to
         `image: ${CASHFLOW_IMAGE:-cashflow:prod}` (keep `build: .` — the
         laptop prod-config test still builds locally; the server's
         `/opt/bot/.env` adds `CASHFLOW_IMAGE=ghcr.io/edgar-84/cashflow:latest`
         — lowercase, GHCR requirement) + a json-file `logging:` rotation
         block per service (max-size/max-file).
      2. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: on push to master — build and push
         `ghcr.io/edgar-84/cashflow` tagged `latest` + `<commit sha>` (the
         sha tag is the rollback path), then SSH (repo secrets `SSH_HOST`/
         `SSH_USER`/`SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`) → `cd /opt/bot && docker compose
         pull && docker compose up -d`. Add `platforms: linux/arm64` to the
         build step if the instance is t4g (ARM).
      3. README gains a Deployment section: one-time server bootstrap (EC2 +
         docker install, `/opt/bot/` with a copy of the prod compose file
         renamed `docker-compose.yml` + hand-written `.env` `chmod 600`,
         GHCR read-only token `docker login`), and day-2 ops (rollback via
         sha tag, `.env` edit → `up -d --force-recreate`, logs).
      AC: `CASHFLOW_IMAGE=ghcr.io/... docker compose -f
      docker-compose.prod.yml config` resolves to the GHCR image AND the
      no-var default still resolves to `cashflow:prod`; workflow YAML
      lint-clean (actionlint or a branch push dry-run); verify.sh green
      (no Python changes). The server-side bootstrap itself is executed
      manually by the human per README — not automated by this unit.
      Model: sonnet.

## Risks
- Permission matrix subtleties (own_only vs override rows) — mitigated by
  the U2.1 test grid; do not hand-wave any cell.
- Timezone handling in period aggregation (TIMESTAMPTZ vs "current month"
  for the family's local time) — decide in U1.3, record in Decision log.
- Supabase connection pooling (pgbouncer) vs asyncpg prepared statements —
  if connection errors appear in U0.4, set statement_cache_size=0.

## Decision log
- D1 (plan review): bot→backend requests carry X-Internal-Token shared
  secret; backend rejects requests without it. Rejected: exposing backend
  with tg_id header only — spoofable by anyone with the URL.
- D2 (plan review): expenses.category_id is NOT NULL; a default "General"
  category is seeded per account in the initial migration. Rejected:
  nullable category — complicates stats and budget matching.
- D3 (plan review): notification send is best-effort; failures logged,
  never propagate to expense creation. Rejected: synchronous hard fail.
- D4 (plan review): APScheduler dropped from V1; threshold notifications
  fire on create only. Rejected: scheduled digests — no V1 requirement.
- D5 (plan review): category delete = ON DELETE RESTRICT + API returns 409.
  Rejected: SET NULL (contradicts D2), soft delete (V2 complexity).
- D6 (U0.1): added `pythonpath = ["."]` and an `asyncpg.*` mypy override to
  pyproject.toml. Required for the flat layout (no `src/`) to let pytest
  import root modules (`main`, `database`, `config`) and for mypy to accept
  asyncpg's missing type stubs. Not a contract change — tooling config only.
- D7 (U0.2): added `models/__init__.py` (empty). Without it, mypy scanning
  `.` resolved `models/tag.py` under two module names ("tag" and
  "models.tag") and failed with a duplicate-module error. Tooling fix only;
  other currently-empty packages (`repositories/`, `services/`, `api/`,
  `bot/`) will need the same `__init__.py` once they gain `.py` files.
- D8 (U0.2): `Resource.BUDGET_PLANS` enum value is `"budget_plans"`, matching
  the table name. SCHEMA.sql's comment on `permissions.resource` lists
  `budgets` instead — that comment is stale/inconsistent with the actual
  table name `budget_plans`; the table name was treated as authoritative.
  Flag if `permissions.resource` ever needs to literally read `"budgets"`.
- D9 (U0.2): `LimitExceeded` implemented as `LimitExceededWarning(DomainError)`
  in `models/errors.py` — a typed signal for "budget threshold crossed", not
  necessarily raised to abort a request (consistent with D3: notification
  failures/threshold crossings must never fail expense creation). Services
  wiring this up (M3) decide whether it's raised-and-caught or just
  constructed and passed to notification_service.
- D11 (U0.3): `docs/SCHEMA.sql` gained explicit `ON DELETE RESTRICT` on the
  two FKs to `categories(id)` (`expenses.category_id`, `budget_plans.category_id`)
  to match D5 and the "never rely on the FK default" rule in
  `migrations/CLAUDE.md`, plus the three indexes named in this unit's AC
  (`ix_expenses_account_id_created_at`, `ix_expenses_category_id`,
  `ix_expense_tags_tag_id`). Scope was kept to exactly what D5/the AC called
  for — the other FKs (`account_id`, `user_id` refs) still rely on the
  Postgres default (`NO ACTION`), which is a latent inconsistency with
  `migrations/CLAUDE.md`'s explicit-`ON DELETE` rule; not fixed here since
  choosing CASCADE/RESTRICT for each is an unreviewed architecture call
  beyond this unit's budget. Flag before or during M1 (repositories touch
  delete behavior directly).
- D10 (post-U0.2 correction): added `updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()` to
  `expenses` and `budget_plans` in `docs/SCHEMA.sql`, plus a `set_updated_at()`
  trigger function and a `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger on each table (DB-maintained,
  app code must never set it). `models/CLAUDE.md` updated to require the field
  on `ExpenseResponse`/`BudgetPlanResponse` only, never `Create`/`Update`.
  Contract change to already-reviewed U0.2 output. Follow-up applied same
  session: `ExpenseResponse`/`BudgetPlanResponse` gained `updated_at: datetime`
  (required, no default — matches "trigger always sets it"); `tests/test_models.py`
  updated, incl. a case proving each `Response` rejects a payload missing
  `updated_at`.
- D12 (U0.3 review fixes): three findings from PR review, all fixed same
  session:
  1. BLOCKER — `expenses.category_id` was missing `NOT NULL` in both
     `docs/SCHEMA.sql` and the migration (copy-paste of a pre-existing gap
     in the canonical SQL). This directly contradicted D2 and the
     non-negotiable rule in root `CLAUDE.md` ("`expenses.category_id` is
     NOT NULL") — `models/expense.py`'s `ExpenseBase.category_id: UUID`
     (non-optional) already assumed this was enforced at the DB level.
     Fixed in both files.
  2. Downgrade correctness was untested against a real DB (offline `--sql`
     mode only proves syntax, not that Postgres accepts it). Fixed by
     adding an "upgrade head → downgrade base → upgrade head" round-trip
     step to CI's `integration` job (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), ahead of
     the "Run integration tests" step — closed now rather than deferred to
     U0.4.
  3. NIT — `migrations/env.py`'s `target_metadata = None` means
     `alembic revision --autogenerate` can never detect a diff (no ORM
     layer to diff against, by design — raw SQL, no ORM). Documented in
     `migrations/CLAUDE.md`: autogenerate is not usable in this project,
     every migration uses the blank-revision + hand-written `op.execute()`
     path.

- D13 (U0.4): `tests/conftest.py`'s env-defaults fixture only sets a var via
  `monkeypatch.setenv` when it isn't already present in `os.environ`
  (`os.environ.get(key, default)`), instead of unconditionally overwriting
  it as `test_health.py`'s old local fixture did. Required so the same
  autouse fixture can be shared by every test: in CI's `integration` job the
  real `DATABASE_URL`/`INTERNAL_TOKEN`/etc. are already exported by the
  workflow, and unconditional overwrite would have clobbered them with the
  dummy unit-test values. `db_pool` (session-scoped asyncpg pool) similarly
  reads `os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL", ...)` directly rather than going
  through `get_settings()`, avoiding a session/function fixture-scope
  mismatch with the (function-scoped) monkeypatch env fixture; its fallback
  DSN matches the CI `integration` job's postgres service
  (`postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/cashflow_test`) so
  `pytest -m integration` also works against a local docker Postgres with no
  extra config. Not a contract change — test tooling only.
- D14 (U0.4): `tests/factories.py` helpers (`make_account`, `make_category`,
  `make_user`, `make_expense`) insert directly via raw `asyncpg` SQL rather
  than going through a repository layer, since `repositories/` doesn't exist
  yet (M1). They return the Pydantic `Response` models via
  `model_validate(dict(row))`. Once M1 lands real repos, M1 tests may prefer
  calling repos directly; these factories stay useful as thin DB-seeding
  helpers for tests that aren't testing the repo itself (e.g. service/API
  tests in M2+).
- D15 (U0.4): `tests/test_sanity.py` (the pre-U0.4 bootstrap placeholder)
  deleted per its own comment now that real coverage exists
  (`test_health.py` via the new `client` fixture = the "dummy repo-less"
  case; `test_db_roundtrip.py` = the DB round-trip case).

- D16 (U0.4 PR #4 CI fix): CI's `integration` job failed
  `test_expense_round_trip` with
  `asyncpg.exceptions._base.InterfaceError: cannot perform operation:
  another operation is in progress` (root cause:
  `RuntimeError: ...Future ... attached to a different loop`). Cause:
  `db_pool` was session-scoped but `pytest-asyncio` gives each async test
  its own event loop by default, so the pool's connections were bound to
  one test's loop and broke when reused from another. Fixed by switching
  `db_pool`/`db_conn` in `tests/conftest.py` to
  `pytest_asyncio.fixture(..., loop_scope="session")`, and marking
  `test_expense_round_trip` with `@pytest.mark.asyncio(loop_scope="session")`
  — scoped to just the integration fixtures/test, not a global
  `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope` change, so unit tests are
  unaffected. Not yet confirmed green in CI (pushed for re-run).

- D17 (U1.1): `BaseRepository[T]` takes a live `asyncpg.Connection` (not a
  `Pool`) in its constructor — chosen so repo instances can be handed the
  same connection `tests/conftest.py`'s `db_conn` fixture already opened a
  transaction on (U0.4's per-test rollback isolation pattern). If repos
  acquired their own connection from a pool internally, repo queries
  wouldn't participate in that transaction and test isolation would break.
  Production call sites (services, via a future FastAPI dependency) get a
  connection per request from `database.get_connection()` and construct the
  repo with it. `get`/`update` return `T | None` (not-found is not
  exceptional at this layer — services decide whether to raise
  `NotFoundError`); `create`/`update` take `dict[str, Any]` (callers pass
  `Create`/`Update.model_dump(exclude_unset=True)`); `delete` returns `bool`.
  `list(**filters)` does simple equality AND-filtering, sufficient for the
  generic case — richer queries (joins, aggregates) live on the concrete
  repo per repositories/CLAUDE.md's "Query surface", not here.
- D19 (U1.2): `docs/SCHEMA.sql` has no `UNIQUE(account_id, name)` constraint
  on `categories` or `tags` — the AC's "unique-per-account behavior
  documented in tests" is satisfied by a test that proves and documents the
  *actual* (unenforced) behavior (duplicate names within one account
  currently succeed), not by adding a DB constraint. No migration touched —
  `migrations/versions/` is in root CLAUDE.md's do-not-edit-without-asking
  list, and adding a real constraint is an unreviewed schema change beyond
  this unit's scope. Flag before any upstream code (service layer) assumes
  category/tag names are unique per account — they are not, at the DB level,
  today.
- D20 (U1.3): `ExpenseRepository.get_by_period`/`sum_by_category_month` take explicit
  tz-aware `start`/`end` datetime bounds from the caller rather than computing
  "current month" internally — the repo has no notion of the family's local
  timezone (not in config), so pushing boundary computation to the caller
  (future `statistics_service`/`budget_service`) keeps the repo timezone-
  agnostic while still being correct: TIMESTAMPTZ comparison is instant-based,
  so any tz-aware bound works regardless of the offset the caller expresses it
  in. Tested explicitly with equivalent instants expressed in different UTC
  offsets straddling a month boundary. Review follow-up (same session):
  `sum_by_category_month`'s SQL changed to `SUM(amount)::bigint AS total` —
  Postgres promotes `SUM(bigint)` to `numeric`, so asyncpg was returning
  `decimal.Decimal` instead of `int`, a real money-rule violation the
  original test didn't catch (`Decimal(3500) == 3500` passes despite the
  wrong type). Now asserted explicitly with `type(...) is int`. Also added
  account-scoping tests for `get_by_period` and `sum_by_category_month`
  (previously only `get_by_category` had one).
- D21 (U1.3): `ExpenseRepository` overrides `get`/`list`/`create`/`update` (not
  just adding new methods) to attach `tags` via a join on `expense_tags`,
  since `BaseRepository`'s generic CRUD has no notion of a junction table and
  `ExpenseResponse.tags` must be populated for these to be meaningful. `create`
  and `update` accept an optional `tag_ids` key in the input dict (matching
  `ExpenseCreate`/`ExpenseUpdate.model_dump()`); `update`'s `tag_ids` is
  replace-semantics (delete then reinsert), not a diff/merge. `delete` is not
  overridden — `expense_tags.expense_id` has `ON DELETE CASCADE` (docs/SCHEMA.sql),
  so removing the expense row is sufficient; confirmed by an explicit test.
  Review follow-up (same session): `create`/`update` now wrap their
  expense-row + junction-row writes in `async with self._conn.transaction():`
  (asyncpg nests this as a SAVEPOINT when already inside a transaction, so it
  composes safely with the test fixture's per-test transaction) — without it,
  a PK violation on a duplicate `tag_id` or an FK violation on a stale one
  would abort partway through and leave an expense created/updated with only
  some of its intended tags. Covered by
  `test_create_with_duplicate_tag_ids_rolls_back_whole_expense`.
- D22 (U1.3, mypy/runtime gotcha): defining a method literally named `list` on
  `ExpenseRepository` broke every other method's `list[...]` return-type
  annotation in the same class body — Python (and mypy, matching its scoping)
  resolves a bare name in a class body against names already bound earlier in
  that same class body before falling back to builtins, so `list[ExpenseResponse]`
  after the `list` method definition resolved to the method itself, not
  `builtins.list` (`TypeError: 'function' object is not subscriptable` at
  import time). Fixed by moving the `list` method to be the last definition in
  the class; `from __future__ import annotations` alone did not fix mypy's
  static check (it applies the same class-body scoping rule regardless).
  Flag if any future repository subclass needs a method that shadows a
  builtin used in its own class's later annotations.
- D23 (U1.4): `BudgetPlanRepository.check_limit`'s signature deviates from
  repositories/CLAUDE.md's originally-documented `check_limit(category_id,
  account_id) -> float`: now `check_limit(account_id, category_id, *, start,
  end) -> float | None`. (1) `account_id`-first parameter order matches
  `expense_repo`'s convention (`get_by_category`, `get_by_period`,
  `sum_by_category_month`). (2) Takes explicit tz-aware `start`/`end` month
  bounds from the caller instead of computing "current month" internally,
  consistent with D20 — the repo layer has no notion of the family's local
  timezone. (3) Returns `float | None`: `None` signals no `budget_plans` row
  exists for that (account, category), distinguishing "no plan" from "0%
  spent" — both are valid, distinct AC cases (parametrized tests: no plan,
  0%, exactly at `notify_threshold`, >100%). `repositories/CLAUDE.md` and
  `services/CLAUDE.md` (its notification-flow invariant referenced the old
  signature) updated to match. SQL: `COALESCE(SUM(e.amount), 0)::bigint`
  keeps the spent-total an exact `bigint` (no `Decimal` leak, per D20's
  precedent); `GROUP BY bp.id` (not `bp.amount` — grouping by a non-key
  column would silently merge/duplicate rows once a second `period` value
  exists alongside `Period = Literal["monthly"]`, a reviewer-caught latent
  bug fixed before merge, currently unreachable but cheap to close now).
  `check_limit` also returns `None` (not a `ZeroDivisionError`) for a
  non-positive `amount` — `models/budget_plan.py`'s `BudgetPlanBase.amount`
  has no positivity constraint (pre-existing model gap, not fixed here since
  `models/` is U0.2's reviewed contract and DB `CHECK` constraints require a
  migration; flagged for whoever adds `Field(gt=0)`/a schema `CHECK` later).
  Reviewed by the reviewer subagent same session (APPROVE, with WARNs — the
  `GROUP BY`/zero-amount items above fixed same session; a
  `test_duplicate_plan_raises_unique_violation` test added documenting that
  `budget_plans`' real `UNIQUE(category_id, account_id, period)` constraint
  — unlike categories/tags' unenforced case, D19 — raises a raw
  `asyncpg.UniqueViolationError`, untranslated to a domain exception, same
  pre-existing gap as every other repo today; not fixed here, flagged for
  M2 service-layer error translation).
- D24 (U1.5): `PermissionRepository.get_by_user_and_resource(user_id: UUID,
  resource: Resource) -> PermissionResponse | None` implements
  repositories/CLAUDE.md's "fetch per-(user, resource) row for the auth
  pipeline" query-surface line, which named the purpose but not an exact
  signature. Takes the `Resource` enum (not a raw `str`) to match the model
  layer (`PermissionBase.resource: Resource`); `resource.value` used for the
  SQL parameter since the `resource` column is `TEXT`. Duplicate
  `(user_id, resource)` inserts raise a raw `asyncpg.UniqueViolationError`
  (DB has `UNIQUE(user_id, resource)`, docs/SCHEMA.sql), untranslated to a
  domain exception — same pre-existing gap as `budget_plans` (D23), flagged
  again for the same M2 service-layer error-translation follow-up.
- D25 (U2.1): `api/deps.py` is the API layer's composition root — the one
  place under `api/` that imports from `repositories/`. `api/CLAUDE.md`'s
  blanket "Never import from `repositories/` here" rule contradicted the same
  doc's Structure/Auth sections (which put repo/service factories and the
  `user_repo` lookup inside `deps.py`); the rule line was clarified to
  "never in router modules; `deps.py` is the exception". `get_current_user`
  resolves tg_id via the generic `user_repo.list(tg_id=...)` filter instead
  of adding a `get_by_tg_id` method — no repo edit needed, keeps the unit
  inside `api/` + tests.
- D26 (U2.1): PermissionChecker design. The 6-step order is split into:
  `get_current_user` (step 1: `X-Internal-Token` via `secrets.compare_digest`
  + `X-Telegram-User-Id` → user, any failure → 401; the tg header is declared
  `str` and parsed by hand so a malformed value 401s instead of FastAPI's
  422), pure `resolve_permission(role, resource, action, permission_row) ->
  PermissionDecision(allowed, own_only)` (steps 2–5 — this is what the AC's
  48-cell grid tests directly), and `enforce_ownership(decision, user,
  owner_id)` (step 6 — the checker can't know the target record at
  dependency-resolution time, so `PermissionChecker.__call__` stores the
  decision on `request.state.permission_decision` and the route/service
  owning the record applies step 6; call-site choice deferred to U2.4).
  `__call__` returns the user per the api/CLAUDE.md route-pattern contract
  and accepts `Resource | str` / `Action | str` (contract shows string form).
  Literal step-order semantics locked in by tests: step 2 before 4 → an
  all-False row cannot restrict an admin; step 3 before 4 → a viewer can
  never be granted writes, but a row's `can_read=False` DOES restrict a
  viewer's reads (step 3 only blocks writes); an override row replaces role
  defaults entirely (a member can lose default expense create); in member
  defaults `own_only` applies only to expense update/delete (matrix C·R are
  unqualified). Repo factories (`get_user_repo`/`get_permission_repo`) are
  the dependency_overrides seam that keeps the unit tests hermetic.
- D27 (U2.2): `users`/`permissions` are admin-only CRUD with no override-row or
  `own_only` semantics in the matrix, and aren't in the `Resource` enum. Rather
  than extend that enum (a contract change to U0.2/U2.1's reviewed matrix
  types) or force them through `PermissionChecker`, `api/deps.py` gained a
  standalone `require_admin` dependency: authenticate via `get_current_user`,
  then a plain `role is Role.ADMIN` check, 403 otherwise. Resolves the open
  question left in U2.1's handoff note. `PermissionChecker`/`Resource` are
  unchanged.
- D28 (U2.2): added `ConflictError(DomainError)` to `models/errors.py` — no
  existing domain error fit "operation violates a uniqueness constraint".
  Anticipated by D23/D24 (repos raise raw `asyncpg.UniqueViolationError`,
  M2 services own translating it). `UserService.create` catches
  `asyncpg.UniqueViolationError` (duplicate `tg_id`, `users.tg_id UNIQUE`) and
  raises `ConflictError`; `main.py` gained its first domain-exception→HTTP
  mapping (`NotFoundError`→404, `ConflictError`→409, `PermissionDeniedError`→403,
  via `@app.exception_handler`, per api/CLAUDE.md's "global handler in
  main.py" option) since no route needed one before this unit.
- D29 (U2.2): `UserService.create`/`update`/`delete`/`get` take an explicit
  `account_id` param (the calling admin's own, from `require_admin`'s
  returned user) and ignore/override `UserCreate.account_id` even though
  that field is part of the U0.2 contract — root CLAUDE.md's "never trust
  client-supplied UUIDs" applies regardless of what the model shape allows;
  not a model change, just a service-layer rule. `get`/`update`/`delete`
  404 (not 403) when a `user_id` exists but belongs to a different account,
  so admins can't probe for other accounts' user ids. `UserService` depends
  on a `UserRepositoryProtocol` (structural, tests/CLAUDE.md's "repository
  interfaces are protocols/duck-typed"), not the concrete `UserRepository`,
  so `tests/test_user_service.py` passes an in-memory `FakeUserRepo` with no
  DB.
- D30 (U2.2 review fix): `UserService.update` filters explicit `None` values
  out of the `UserUpdate.model_dump(exclude_unset=True)` payload before
  calling the repo. Without this, `PATCH /users/{id}` with `{"name": null}` or
  `{"role": null}` reached `UserRepository.update` as `SET name = NULL`
  against `users.name`/`users.role`, both `NOT NULL` columns — an uncaught
  `asyncpg.NotNullViolationError` surfacing as an unhandled 500. Since
  neither field has a legitimate null state at the DB level, an explicit
  null is now treated the same as an omitted field (silently ignored, not a
  422) rather than adding a new domain error type for this one case. Covered
  by `test_update_explicit_null_fields_are_ignored_not_nulled`,
  `test_update_mixes_real_value_with_ignored_null` (service level) and
  `test_update_user_explicit_null_is_ignored_not_500` (API level). Found by
  a review pass on this unit's diff.
- D32 (U2.3): `CategoryService`/`TagService` follow `UserService`'s D29/D30
  patterns exactly: constructor-DI'd structural `*RepositoryProtocol`,
  `account_id` always the caller's own (never client-supplied), and
  `update()` drops explicit `None` values from the payload before calling
  the repo — `categories.name`/`tags.name` are `NOT NULL` columns with no
  "clear" semantics, same gap D30 fixed for `users.name`/`users.role`.
  `CategoryService.delete` additionally catches
  `asyncpg.ForeignKeyViolationError` (raised by `expenses.category_id`/
  `budget_plans.category_id`'s `ON DELETE RESTRICT`, D5) and translates it
  to `ConflictError`, reusing D28's domain type rather than adding a new
  one — `main.py`'s existing `ConflictError`→409 handler covers it with no
  new wiring. `TagService.delete` has no equivalent try/except:
  `expense_tags.tag_id` is `ON DELETE CASCADE` (docs/SCHEMA.sql), so a tag
  delete cannot raise a FK violation. Routes use `PermissionChecker`
  (not `require_admin` — categories/tags are in the `Resource` enum, D27
  doesn't apply) with no `enforce_ownership` call: the default matrix has
  no `own_only` concept for these two resources (api/CLAUDE.md, D26).
  `api/categories.py`/`api/tags.py`'s `PermissionChecker(...)` call sites use
  the `Resource`/`Action` enum members, not string literals — these are
  categories/tags being the first routes to actually wire `PermissionChecker`
  (U2.1 built and tested it, U2.2's `users` used `require_admin` instead).
  `api/CLAUDE.md`'s route-pattern example updated to match (enum form is now
  the documented default for new call sites; string form still supported,
  D26, and still covered by `test_permission_checker_accepts_enum_and_string_forms`).
- D31 (post-U2.2 architecture review): no Unit-of-Work / request-wide
  transaction layer in V1 — evaluated and deliberately deferred. Rationale:
  (1) UoW buys atomicity, not performance — asyncpg's pool already covers
  connection reuse, and a request-wide BEGIN/COMMIT would only hold
  connections in a transaction longer on read-only routes; (2) V1 has no
  cross-repo multi-write anywhere in the plan: multi-statement writes inside
  one repo are already wrapped in `conn.transaction()` per
  repositories/CLAUDE.md, and the one cross-service flow (expense →
  notification, U3.1) is explicitly anti-transactional (a failed send must
  NOT roll back the expense); (3) the retrofit is cheap because the
  architecture is already UoW-shaped — `database.get_connection` is a
  per-request dependency and FastAPI caches it, so all repos in one request
  already share a single connection. ADD IT WHEN the first cross-repo
  atomic write appears — expected first case: V2 bot self-registration
  (account + user + seeded "General" category + permission row must commit
  together). Implementation then: a small UoW class (connection +
  `conn.transaction()` + repo accessors) or a transactional variant of
  `get_connection`, wired in `api/deps.py`; no repo/service rewrites
  required. Current session/transaction model is documented in
  repositories/CLAUDE.md ("Connection & transaction model").
- D18 (U1.1, environment gotcha, not fixed): `alembic upgrade head` fails
  locally on this machine (macOS arm64) with
  `ValueError: the greenlet library is required...` — `uv.lock`'s
  `sqlalchemy` dependency marks `greenlet` as required only when
  `platform_machine` is `aarch64`/`x86_64`/etc., but macOS ARM reports
  `arm64`, so `uv sync` never installs it here. Pre-existing gap, unrelated
  to this unit, and `uv.lock` is in root CLAUDE.md's do-not-edit-without-asking
  list, so not fixed. CI runs on ubuntu (`x86_64`, marker matches) and is
  unaffected. Worked around for this unit's local verification only: started
  a throwaway `postgres:16` Docker container and applied `docs/SCHEMA.sql`
  directly via `psql` (bypassing Alembic) to get a real schema to run the
  new integration tests against; container removed after. Flag before
  relying on local `alembic upgrade head` again.
- D33 (U2.4): `ExpenseService` has no notion of permissions/`own_only` at all —
  unlike the U2.4 handoff note's literal wording ("the route... passes it into
  the service"), ownership enforcement (step 6) is done entirely in
  `api/expenses.py`, not the service: the route calls `service.get(...)` first
  (404 + fetches `owner_id`), then `api.deps.enforce_ownership(request.state.
  permission_decision, user, expense.user_id)` directly, then calls
  `service.update`/`service.delete`. Rejected: passing `PermissionDecision` (or
  `request`) into `ExpenseService` — `api/deps.py` imports service classes for
  its factories (`get_expense_service`), so a service importing anything from
  `api.deps` would be a circular import; passing a bare `own_only: bool` was
  also considered but decided against since `enforce_ownership` already exists,
  is unit-tested (U2.1), and raises `HTTPException` directly, which services
  must not do (services/CLAUDE.md: only domain exceptions). Net effect for
  `own_only`-gated routes (update/delete, plus the single-record `GET`): the
  target record is fetched twice (once by the route for the ownership check,
  once more inside `service.get`/`update`/`delete`) — acceptable per D31 (no
  request-wide transaction/UoW in V1, extra reads have no atomicity cost).
  `enforce_ownership` is also called on single-record `GET`, not just
  update/delete: api/CLAUDE.md's step 6 says "target record belongs to another
  user", not "only on write" — this matters if a future per-user `permissions`
  override row sets `own_only=true` for `read` (the *default* matrix only sets
  `own_only` for expense update/delete, per D26, but an override row could
  still do it for read). Review fix (same session): `GET /expenses` (list)
  initially had no ownership filtering at all — a BLOCKER, since an override
  row's `own_only` applies per (user, resource), not per action, and
  `permissions.own_only` defaults to `true` (`models/permission.py`), so any
  admin granting a member, say, `can_delete=true` on expenses without
  explicitly setting `own_only=false` would silently leave `GET /expenses`
  showing every account expense while `GET /expenses/{id}` on someone else's
  403s. Fixed: `list_expenses` reads `request.state.permission_decision` and
  filters to `user.id` when `decision.own_only` is set — `enforce_ownership`
  itself isn't reused here (it 403s against one `owner_id`; a list has no
  single target record to 403 against), so this is a plain filter, not a call
  to that function. Covered by
  `test_list_expenses_with_own_only_override_filters_to_own`.
  `ExpenseService.update` also has a
  finer-grained null-handling rule than `CategoryService`/`TagService`'s D30/
  D32 precedent: `amount`/`category_id` are `NOT NULL` (explicit null dropped,
  same as D30), but `comment` IS nullable (`docs/SCHEMA.sql`) — an explicit
  `{"comment": null}` is a real "clear the comment" and is NOT dropped, unlike
  the single-mutable-field categories/tags case where every field was
  `NOT NULL`. `tag_ids` needs no special-casing here — `ExpenseRepository`
  (U1.3, D21) already treats an explicit `null`/absent `tag_ids` identically
  ("don't touch tags"), only an explicit `[]` clears them. No new category/
  account-scoping validation added for `category_id`/`tag_ids` on create/
  update (categories/tags belonging to a foreign account are accepted without
  error, same latent gap as `budget_plans` in D23) — flagged, not fixed, since
  it's beyond this unit's AC (create/list/update/delete + own_only + tag
  attach/detach) and would be a genuinely new validation decision.

- D34 (U2.5): `BudgetService.get_progress` computes its own spent/limit percentage
  from two *existing* repo methods — `budget_plan_repo.get(id)` (limit, as `int`)
  and `expense_repo.sum_by_category_month(account_id, start, end)` (spent per
  category, as `int`, D20's `Decimal`-leak fix already applied) — rather than
  reusing `BudgetPlanRepository.check_limit` (U1.4, D23), per the plan's own
  U2.5 handoff note ("no new repo method expected"). Rejected: delegating to
  `check_limit`, whose float-only return can't power `remaining`/`spent` as
  real `int` money for the API/bot (U4.5 AC needs "totals formatted from minor
  units"), and whose `None`-for-no-plan case doesn't apply here anyway (the
  service already 404s via `get()` before computing progress). The pure
  `calculate_progress(spent, limit, notify_threshold)` function mirrors
  `check_limit`'s zero/negative-`limit` guard (`fill_pct=None`, not a
  `ZeroDivisionError`) and is fully unit-testable without a DB — this is the
  AC's "progress calc — pure logic, int math only" (parametrized in
  `tests/test_budget_service.py`: 0%, exactly at threshold, >100%, zero/negative
  limit). `get_progress`'s "current month" bounds default to UTC (`datetime.now(UTC)`,
  overridable via a `now` kwarg for tests) since `config.py` has no family-timezone
  setting yet — same gap D20/D23 already left for `expense_repo`'s period methods'
  callers; flag again if/when a family timezone is added to config.
  `BudgetService.create` also translates the real `UNIQUE(category_id, account_id,
  period)` violation to `ConflictError` (closing the D23/D24-flagged gap, following
  the D28/D32 translation pattern). `models/budget_plan.py` gained an additive
  `BudgetProgress` model (not one of the four-schema-pattern entities — a computed
  summary built directly by the service, never `from_attributes`). `api/budgets.py`
  routes are `PermissionChecker(Resource.BUDGET_PLANS, ...)`-gated with no
  `enforce_ownership` call, matching D32's categories/tags pattern — `budget_plans`
  has no `user_id` column and no `own_only` concept in the matrix.

- D35 (U2.6): `StatisticsService` (by_period/by_category/by_tag, current-month only,
  `_current_month_bounds` helper duplicated from `budget_service.py` — same
  small pure function, D34 precedent, not promoted to a shared module since
  that would touch `budget_service.py` outside this unit's scope) is built on
  a single existing repo method, `expense_repo.get_by_period` (already attaches
  tags per D21) — no new repo method needed for by-tag after all, contrary to
  the U2.5 handoff note's guess. All three aggregates are computed in Python
  from that one fetched list rather than reusing `sum_by_category_month` for
  by-category, so `own_only` filtering (see below) can apply uniformly before
  aggregation. Statistics has no `Resource` enum entry of its own — routes are
  gated by `PermissionChecker(Resource.EXPENSES, Action.READ)` since it's a
  derived read-only view over expense data, not a new resource (no `Resource`/
  matrix contract change). `StatisticsService` methods take an optional
  `user_id` filter, applied before aggregation; `api/statistics.py`'s routes
  pass `user.id` when `request.state.permission_decision.own_only` is set,
  mirroring D33's `list_expenses` own_only handling. This is a deliberate,
  narrow divergence from D33's "services have no notion of permissions" rule:
  `user_id` here is a plain data filter (like `account_id`), not a
  `PermissionDecision`/`request` object, so it doesn't reintroduce the
  circular-import or service-raises-HTTPException problems D33 rejected — and
  D33's own alternative (filter the route's returned list post-hoc) doesn't
  work here since these methods return aggregates, not raw records.

- D36 (U3.1): `NotificationService.send(user, category, fill_pct)` (services/CLAUDE.md's
  literal invariant signature) POSTs directly to the Telegram Bot API
  (`https://api.telegram.org/bot{token}/sendMessage`) via an injected
  `httpx.AsyncClient`, `chat_id=user.tg_id` — the expense creator, not every
  account member (simplest reading of "user" in the invariant; no AC calls
  for a fan-out to all admins). `ExpenseService.create` gained three new
  constructor deps (`budget_plan_repo`, `category_repo`, `notification_service`,
  all narrow Protocols per the existing pattern) and a `_check_budget_and_notify`
  step: `check_limit()` for `fill_pct`, then a second `budget_plan_repo.list(
  account_id=, category_id=)` call to recover the plan's `notify_threshold`
  (`check_limit` itself only returns the percentage, not the plan row — no
  new repo method needed, same "no new repo method expected" precedent as
  D34/D35), then `category_repo.get()` for the display name. The whole check
  (not just the HTTP send) is wrapped in `try/except Exception` — root
  CLAUDE.md's best-effort rule is applied to the entire notification path,
  not only `NotificationService.send`'s own internal try/except, so a DB
  hiccup on the budget/category lookup can't undo an already-committed
  expense either. `api/deps.py` gained an `lru_cache`d module-level
  `httpx.AsyncClient` singleton (`_http_client()`, mirrors `config.
  get_settings()`'s pattern) plus `close_http_client()`, called from `main.py`'s
  lifespan `finally` alongside `database.close_pool()` — a full
  lifespan-managed client (like `database.py`'s pool) was initially skipped
  as unnecessary for V1's request volume, then added back in review to avoid
  an unclosed client at process shutdown.
  Reviewed by the reviewer subagent same session (REQUEST_CHANGES — BLOCKER:
  `httpx.HTTPStatusError`'s own message embeds the full request URL, which
  contains the live bot token (`/bot{token}/sendMessage`); the original

  catches `HTTPStatusError` separately and logs only `response.status_code`
  plus structured `extra={tg_id, category_id, fill_pct}` — never `exc`/`str(exc)`

  logging switched to `extra={...}` per services/CLAUDE.md's structured-fields
  convention. WARN not fixed, flagged for a future unit: `check_limit()` +
  `list()` are two separate `budget_plan_repo` round trips per expense create
  to recover `notify_threshold` — harmless today [worst case: a skipped or
  stale-threshold notification, never a money-correctness bug] but an
  avoidable extra query on the hot `POST /expenses` path; consider folding
  `notify_threshold` into `check_limit`'s return in a later unit).

  ownership cases, and HTTP-level 401/403 cases through ASGITransport
  incl. missing/wrong token, missing/malformed/unknown tg_id.
  tests/README.md gained the new section). Reviewed by the reviewer subagent
  same session (APPROVE; WARNs fixed same session: `resolve_permission` now
  fails closed on an unrecognized role instead of falling through to allow —
  `users.role` has no DB CHECK; admin-ignores-row test asserts full decision
  equality so a leaked `own_only` can't slip past; async-fixture NIT fixed).
  verify.sh green (76 non-integration tests). Human still to read the diff
  per plan (MOST COMPLEX LOGIC IN PROJECT).
- Done: U2.2 (services/user_service.py — `UserService`, DI'd via a structural
  `UserRepositoryProtocol` (D29); `list`/`get`/`create`/`update`/`delete` all
  scoped to an explicit `account_id` param (the admin's own, never the
  client-supplied `UserCreate.account_id`, D29); `create` translates
  `asyncpg.UniqueViolationError` (duplicate `tg_id`) to `ConflictError` (D28).
  api/deps.py — `require_admin` (D27), `get_user_service` factory. api/users.py
  — `GET/POST /users`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /users/{id}`, all gated by
  `require_admin`. main.py — registers the router and the project's first
  domain-exception→HTTP handlers (`NotFoundError`→404, `ConflictError`→409,

  tests/test_user_service.py — hermetic, `FakeUserRepo`, account-scoping,
  account_id-override, duplicate-tg_id→`ConflictError`, not-found cases.
  tests/test_users_api.py — hermetic HTTP tests via the real app +
  `app.dependency_overrides`, admin/member/viewer 200-vs-403 per route,
  404/409 mapping, spoofed-account_id-ignored case. tests/README.md gained
  both new sections). Review fix (D30): `UserService.update` drops explicit
  `None` values from the update payload — an unfiltered `{"name": null}` was
  reaching the DB as `SET name = NULL` against a `NOT NULL` column and
  surfacing as an unhandled 500; 3 tests added for this. verify.sh green
  (102 non-integration tests: 76 + 23 new + 3 review-fix).

  structural `CategoryRepositoryProtocol`; services/tag_service.py —
  `TagService`, DI'd via a structural `TagRepositoryProtocol`; both
  account-scoped, both drop explicit-`None` update payloads (D30 pattern,
  D32); `CategoryService.delete` translates a `RESTRICT`-triggered
  `asyncpg.ForeignKeyViolationError` to `ConflictError` (D32). api/deps.py
  — `get_category_repo`/`get_tag_repo`/`get_category_service`/
  `get_tag_service` factories. api/categories.py, api/tags.py — full CRUD
  routers gated by `PermissionChecker(Resource.CATEGORIES/TAGS, Action...)`
  (enum form, D32), no `enforce_ownership` call (no `own_only` concept for
  these resources).
  main.py — registers both routers (no new exception handler needed,
  reuses the existing `ConflictError`→409 mapping).
  tests/test_category_service.py, tests/test_tag_service.py — hermetic,
  `FakeCategoryRepo`/`FakeTagRepo`, account-scoping, explicit-null-ignored,
  not-found cases; category service also covers the RESTRICT→`ConflictError`
  translation. tests/test_categories_api.py, tests/test_tags_api.py —

- Done: U2.4 (services/expense_service.py — `ExpenseService`, DI'd via a
  structural `ExpenseRepositoryProtocol`; no permissions/`own_only` knowledge
  in the service at all — ownership enforcement lives entirely in the route
  (D33). `list`/`get`/`create`/`delete` follow the D29/D32 account-scoping
  pattern (`account_id` always the caller's own); `create` also stamps
  `user_id` from the caller (never client-supplied). `update` drops explicit
  `None` for `amount`/`category_id` (`NOT NULL`, D30/D32 pattern) but NOT for
  `comment` (nullable — explicit null really clears it, D33) or `tag_ids`
  (`ExpenseRepository` already handles absent-vs-null-vs-empty-list, D21).
  api/deps.py — `get_expense_repo`/`get_expense_service` factories. api/expenses.py
  — full CRUD router gated by `PermissionChecker(Resource.EXPENSES, Action...)`;
  update/delete/single-`GET` routes fetch the record via the service then call
  `enforce_ownership(request.state.permission_decision, user, expense.user_id)`
  before mutating — the first real wiring of U2.1's step 6 (D33). main.py —
  registers the router (no new exception handler needed, reuses the existing
  `NotFoundError`→404 mapping; `PermissionDeniedError`→403 isn't even hit by
  this unit since `enforce_ownership` raises `HTTPException` directly, not a
  domain error). `list_expenses` also filters to `user.id` when
  `request.state.permission_decision.own_only` is set (review fix, D33 —
  BLOCKER: list had no ownership filtering at all, reachable the moment an
  override permission row sets `own_only=true` on read).
  tests/test_expense_service.py — hermetic, `FakeExpenseRepo`, account-scoping,
  tag attach/replace/clear, the three-way null-handling split (amount/
  category_id dropped, comment cleared), not-found cases incl. update on a
  foreign-account expense (review NIT — symmetry with get/delete).
  tests/test_expenses_api.py — hermetic HTTP tests via the real app +
  `app.dependency_overrides`, admin/member/viewer 200-vs-403 per route, the
  own_only grid (member own vs. another member's expense on update/delete,
  admin bypass), unqualified list/read, an override-row own_only-on-read case
  for list (review fix), tag attach/replace via HTTP.

  `BudgetPlanRepositoryProtocol` + a narrow `ExpenseSumRepositoryProtocol`
  (just `sum_by_category_month`); `list`/`get`/`create`/`update`/`delete`
  follow the D32 account-scoping pattern (no own_only concept, `budget_plans`
  has no `user_id`); `create` translates `asyncpg.UniqueViolationError`
  (`UNIQUE(category_id, account_id, period)`) to `ConflictError`, closing the
  D23/D24-flagged gap; `update` drops explicit `None` for all three fields
  (`amount`/`period`/`notify_threshold`, all `NOT NULL`, D30/D32 pattern).
  Module-level pure `calculate_progress(spent, limit, notify_threshold) ->
  BudgetProgress` (zero/negative `limit` guard mirrors `check_limit`'s, D23)
  and `get_progress()` orchestrating `budget_plan_repo.get` +
  `expense_repo.sum_by_category_month` (both pre-existing — no new repo
  method, D34). models/budget_plan.py — additive `BudgetProgress` model (not
  a four-schema entity). api/deps.py — `get_budget_plan_repo`/

  rollover] and made the fake record its call args, asserted in

  `by_category`/`by_tag` all aggregate the current month's expenses in Python
  from that one fetch (no new repo method — D35); `_current_month_bounds`
  duplicated from `budget_service.py` (D34/D35). api/deps.py —

  Action.READ)`-gated (statistics has no `Resource` entry of its own, D35);
  routes pass `user_id` to the service when the resolved permission decision
  has `own_only` set, mirroring D33's `list_expenses` handling (D35). main.py

- Done: U3.1 (services/notification_service.py — `NotificationService.send(user,
  category, fill_pct)`, POSTs to the Telegram Bot API via an injected
  `httpx.AsyncClient`, catches `httpx.HTTPStatusError`/`httpx.HTTPError`
  separately and logs only safe structured fields, never the exception itself
  (D36 — token-leak review fix). services/expense_service.py —
  `ExpenseService` gained `budget_plan_repo`/`category_repo`/
  `notification_service` deps (all narrow Protocols); `create()` now calls
  `_check_budget_and_notify()` after persisting the expense — `check_limit()`
  for `fill_pct`, `budget_plan_repo.list()` for `notify_threshold`,
  `category_repo.get()` for the display name, `notification_service.send()`
  if `fill_pct >= notify_threshold`; the whole check wrapped in a blanket
  `try/except Exception` so a DB hiccup here can't undo an already-committed
  expense either (D36). api/deps.py — `_http_client()` `lru_cache`d
  `httpx.AsyncClient` singleton + `close_http_client()`, `get_notification_service`
  factory, `get_expense_service` now wires all three new deps. main.py —

  bot milestone drives: expenses/categories/tags/budget_plans (incl.
  `get_budget_plan_progress`)/statistics (by-period/category/tag) CRUD+reads;
  `users` intentionally not wrapped, no admin UI planned (D37). Every request
  goes through a shared `_request()` helper that attaches
  `X-Telegram-User-Id`/`X-Internal-Token` headers and calls
  `response.raise_for_status()` — non-2xx surfaces as `httpx.HTTPStatusError`
  for handlers (U4.3+) to translate into user-facing messages. bot/middlewares.py
  — `AllowlistMiddleware`, an aiogram outer middleware: reads
  `data["event_from_user"]` (populated by aiogram's built-in
  `UserContextMiddleware`), drops the update (returns `None`, handler never
  runs) if the tg_id is `None` or not in the configured allowlist, otherwise
  constructs a `BackendClient` with that tg_id's headers and injects it as
  `data["client"]` (D37). tests/test_bot_client.py — hermetic,
  `httpx.MockTransport` (D37 — respx not a dependency), one fixture per
  response-model JSON shape, header-injection assertion, per-resource
  CRUD/progress/statistics round trips, non-2xx → `HTTPStatusError`.
  tests/test_bot_middlewares.py — non-allowlisted tg_id dropped before
  handler runs (AC), missing `event_from_user` dropped, allowlisted tg_id
  reaches handler with an injected `BackendClient`, injected client's

  `dp.update.outer_middleware(...)` after `Dispatcher()` construction
  (satisfies U4.1's registration-order requirement — aiogram pre-registers
  `UserContextMiddleware` inside `Dispatcher.__init__`), with a marked

  `amount` still has no positivity constraint (flagged since D23, not touched
  by U2.5/U2.6/U3.1) — flag again if any future unit's math assumes
  `amount > 0`. `budget_plan_repo`'s two-round-trip notification check (D36)
  is a candidate for a follow-up optimization, not urgent. Plan extended
  same session as U4.3a: M6/U6.1 (CD flow, design in D42) queued AFTER M5 —

  before the per-state catch-alls (D39/D40 precedent). bot/bot.py wires
  `create_categories_router()`. tests/test_bot_handlers_categories.py —
  list (non-empty/empty/backend-error), add (happy path/empty-name reprompt/
  permission-denied/backend-error), rename (happy path/no-categories/
  permission-denied), delete (happy path/no-categories/409-conflict), cancel,
  plus a real-`Dispatcher` registration-order regression test. tests/README.md
  gained the new section). Reviewed by the reviewer subagent same session
  (APPROVE — see D43 for the one WARN and three NITs, all handled/flagged
  same session). verify.sh green (316 non-integration tests: 301 + 15 new);
  this unit touches no repository/DB code, so the pre-existing integration
  suite wasn't re-run.
- Done: U4.4b (bot/states.py — `TagManage` StatesGroup, same four states as
  `CategoryManage`. bot/handlers/tags.py — mechanical mirror of
  bot/handlers/categories.py: `cmd_list_tags` (plain, no FSM); add/rename
  single-field "enter a name" forms; rename/delete reuse `tags_keyboard`/
  `TagCallback` from bot/keyboards.py; `TagBackendClient` Protocol; `create_router()`
  registers `/cancel` before the per-state catch-alls (D39/D40/D43 precedent).
  bot/bot.py wires `create_tags_router()`. tests/test_bot_handlers_tags.py —
  same shape as tests/test_bot_handlers_categories.py plus a real-`Dispatcher`
  registration-order regression test. tests/README.md gained the new section.
  See D44 for the one deliberate deviation from the U4.4 mirror (no 409 case
  — tags are `ON DELETE CASCADE` with no unique constraint, D19) and the
  three pre-existing gaps carried over unflagged (same as D43's NITs).
  verify.sh green (331 non-integration tests: 316 + 15 new); this unit
  touches no repository/DB code, so the pre-existing integration suite
  wasn't re-run. Not yet reviewed by the reviewer subagent — pending.
- Done: U4.5 (bot/handlers/budgets.py — `cmd_list_budgets` (`/budgets`, plain,
  no FSM): lists budget plans with a 10-cell text progress bar + spent/limit
  formatted from minor units + exceeded/over-threshold warning, category
  names resolved via `list_categories()` (D45). bot/handlers/statistics.py —
  `cmd_statistics` (`/statistics`, plain, no FSM): current-month period total
  + category/tag breakdowns sorted by total descending. Both scoped to
  read-only rendering only, no budget-plan CRUD commands (D45 — contrast
  D43's categories+tags split). bot/bot.py wires both new routers.
  tests/test_bot_handlers_budgets.py, tests/test_bot_handlers_statistics.py —
  hermetic fake-client tests covering empty lists, unknown-category fallback,
  exceeded/threshold flags, partial-failure continuation on the N+1 progress
  fetch, `fill_pct=None` no-limit case, breakdown sort order, empty-breakdown
  omission. tests/README.md gained both sections; removed the stale "not yet
  populated: handlers/tags, budgets, statistics" bullet (tags had already
  landed in U4.4b without this cleanup). Reviewed by the reviewer subagent
  same session (APPROVE — one WARN + three NITs, all flagged not fixed, see
  D45). verify.sh green (347 non-integration tests: 331 + 16 new); this unit
  touches no repository/DB code, so the pre-existing integration suite
  wasn't re-run.
- Next: U5.1 (e2e smoke @integration: bot client → real API → test DB — add
  expense → appears in list → budget threshold notification fired). This is
  M4's last unit landing; M4 (Bot) is now fully done. `models/budget_plan.py`'s
  `amount` still has no positivity constraint (flagged since D23, not touched
  by U2.5/U2.6/U3.1/U4.5) — flag again if any future unit's math assumes
  `amount > 0`. `budget_plan_repo`'s two-round-trip notification check (D36)
  and `cmd_list_budgets`'s per-plan progress-fetch N+1 (D45) are both
  candidates for a follow-up `with_progress` backend optimization, not
  urgent. `repositories/base.py`'s `list()` has no `ORDER BY` (D40, U4.3b) —
  flag if `/expenses` or any future list view needs a defined display order.
  U4.4b (bot/handlers/tags.py) is still not yet reviewed by the reviewer
  subagent — pending from a prior session, unrelated to U4.5.
- Gotchas: update project CLAUDE.md status checklist manually (per its own
  rule); keep amounts int-only end to end — bot parses user input to minor
  units immediately. A real `.env` now exists on this machine (used live by
  `docker compose up` in U4.3a); tests still set env vars via monkeypatch and
  never read it.
  New packages under repositories/services/api/bot will need an empty
  `__init__.py` each (see D7) or mypy will fail with duplicate-module errors.
  `docs/seed.sql` now exists (manual account/user onboarding, V1 has no
  self-registration) — matches the Account-model deferral below.
  `alembic upgrade head` doesn't work on this machine locally — see D18;
  use a throwaway Docker Postgres + `docs/SCHEMA.sql` via `psql` for local
  integration-test runs until the `uv.lock`/greenlet marker gap is fixed.
  See D11 for the FK `ON DELETE` gap left for
  M1 to pick up. See D22 before naming any repository method after a builtin
  (`list`, `dict`, etc.) used in that class's later type annotations.
  See D23: `budget_plans`' real unique constraint raises a raw
  `asyncpg.UniqueViolationError` on duplicate `(category_id, account_id,
  period)` inserts, untranslated to a domain exception — same gap as every
  other repo today (no repo yet implements repositories/CLAUDE.md's
  "translate unique/FK violations" rule); flag for M2 service-layer error
  translation. `models/budget_plan.py`'s `amount` has no positivity
  constraint (no `Field(gt=0)`, no DB `CHECK`) — `check_limit` guards against
  it (returns `None`), but `create`/`update` still accept `amount <= 0`
  silently; flag if a future unit tightens the model/schema.
- D37 (U4.1): `bot/client.py`'s `BackendClient` wraps only expenses/
  categories/tags/budget_plans/statistics — no `users` methods, since the
  bot has no user-management UI planned (admin panel is V2, root CLAUDE.md
  "Out of scope") and nothing in M4's units calls it. `bot/middlewares.py`'s
  `AllowlistMiddleware` realizes bot/CLAUDE.md's "injects X-Telegram-User-Id
  header into every outgoing API call" by constructing a per-update
  `BackendClient` (headers baked in at construction) and putting it on
  `data["client"]` for the handler to use, rather than the middleware
  touching httpx calls directly — handlers (U4.2+) call backend endpoints
  only through that injected client, so no call site can omit or forge the
  header. Non-allowlisted tg_ids are dropped before the handler (and thus
  before any possible API call) runs at all. Test transport: AC text says
  "respx", but respx isn't a project dependency; used `httpx.MockTransport`
  instead, matching the existing `tests/test_notification_service.py`
  precedent. Not a contract change.
- D38 (U4.2): callback-data wire formats live in `bot/keyboards.py` as aiogram
  `CallbackData` factories for id-carrying buttons (`CategoryCallback` →
  `"category:<uuid>"`, `TagCallback` → `"tag:<uuid>"` — aiogram packs UUIDs as
  dashless hex) and plain string constants for static buttons
  (`tags:done`, `expense:confirm`, `expense:cancel`); U4.3+ handler filters
  must match on these (e.g. `CategoryCallback.filter()`), and the formats are
  locked in by tests/test_bot_keyboards.py. `create_dispatcher` takes its
  deps (`http_client`, `allowed_tg_ids`, `internal_token`) explicitly rather
  than reading `get_settings()` so tests build a fully hermetic dispatcher
  (MockTransport http client, no env); only `main()` touches settings.
  `bot/states.py` ships only the `AddExpense` group — U4.4/U4.5 add their own
  groups when their flows need multi-step state, not before. No handlers in
  this unit (skeleton only, per the plan's unit list — `bot/handlers/` starts
  at U4.3).

- D39 (U4.3): list view split out of this unit into U4.3b — the FSM flow alone
  (implementation + the test coverage its AC requires: happy path, cancel
  mid-flow from two different states, invalid-amount reprompt, backend-error
  paths) already ran ~500 diff lines across 2 files, over the ~300-line unit
  budget; the plan's own contingency note authorized this split. `bot/handlers/
  expenses.py` exposes `create_router() -> Router` (not a module-level `Router()`
  singleton) because a `Router` can only ever attach to one parent `Dispatcher`
  — `tests/test_bot_bot.py` calls `create_dispatcher()` fresh per test, which
  would otherwise raise `RuntimeError` on the second call. Handlers are plain
  module-level functions registered functionally (`router.message.register(fn,
  *filters)`) rather than via `@router.message(...)` decorators, so they stay
  directly importable/callable for unit tests. FSM state stores fetched
  `CategoryResponse`/`TagResponse` objects directly (not just ids), safe only
  because `bot/bot.py`'s `Dispatcher()` uses aiogram's default `MemoryStorage`
  (shallow `dict.copy()`, no serialization) — flag if V1 ever adds a persistent
  FSM storage backend (e.g. Redis), which would need JSON-safe state instead.
  `parse_amount_to_minor_units` uses `Decimal` (not the illustrative
  `int(round(value * 100))` float snippet in `bot/CLAUDE.md`) for exact
  comma/dot/thousands-separator parsing with no float rounding risk; accepts
  `.`/`,` as the decimal separator and space/`\xa0` as a thousands separator,
  rejects non-positive and multi-separator input.
  Reviewed by the reviewer subagent same session (REQUEST_CHANGES — BLOCKER:
  `create_router()`'s registration order let `on_amount_entered`/
  `on_comment_entered` (catch-all per-state text handlers, no command
  exclusion) shadow `/cancel` during the `amount`/comment` states — aiogram
  dispatches to the first handler whose filters match in registration order,
  so `/cancel` was either stored as the literal comment or rejected as an
  invalid amount instead of cancelling. The unit's own tests couldn't catch
  this because they call handler functions directly, bypassing the router
  entirely. Fixed same session by registering `on_cancel_command` immediately
  after `cmd_add_expense`, before the catch-all handlers; two new tests
  dispatch through a real `Dispatcher` + `create_router()` (Telegram network
  mocked via `Message.answer` patched to an `AsyncMock`) to lock this in.
  Two WARNs also fixed same session: `cmd_add_expense`'s `list_categories()`
  and `_prompt_tags_or_confirm`'s `list_tags()` calls had no error handling
  [violated bot/CLAUDE.md's "errors surface as human messages, never raw
  tracebacks" for any path but `create_expense`] — both now catch
  `httpx.HTTPError` and show a friendly message; `on_confirm` widened its
  catch from `httpx.HTTPStatusError` to `httpx.HTTPError` so a connection/
  timeout failure (not just a non-2xx response) also degrades gracefully
  instead of crashing the handler. Two NITs flagged, not fixed [stale FSM
  data merged rather than reset on `/add` restart — currently harmless, every
  field consumed before use is overwritten by a later step; `_confirm_summary`
  uses bare `dict` subscript access rather than `.get()` with a fallback —
  low risk now that the registration-order bug is fixed, but would raise a
  raw `KeyError` instead of a friendly message if state were ever entered
  incomplete]. A second reviewer pass on the same diff independently re-verified
  the BLOCKER/WARN fixes above and returned APPROVE, re-confirming the two NITs
  and adding one more, also flagged not fixed as out of this unit's AC:
  `on_confirm` (`bot/handlers/expenses.py`) has no guard against a double-tap
  on the Confirm button (e.g. under network lag) — `callback.answer()` fires
  immediately but nothing disables/removes the keyboard before the
  `create_expense` call completes, so two taps in quick succession could both
  reach `client.create_expense` and create a duplicate expense. Flag for a
  future unit (e.g. clearing state/disabling the keyboard optimistically
  before the API call, or an idempotency key if the backend gains one).

- D40 (plan extension, 2026-07-18): added U4.3a — Docker packaging for local
  laptop testing and AWS production. Decisions locked in up front so the
  implementing session only executes:
  1. ONE image for api + bot (same codebase, same lockfile) — the compose
     service picks the command. Rejected: two Dockerfiles (double build time
     and drift risk for zero isolation gain; the bot already imports nothing
     DB-side by design).
  2. Local stack runs REAL Alembic migrations via a one-shot `migrate`
     compose service, not the `psql docs/SCHEMA.sql` shortcut from
     `scripts/integration_docker.sh` — D18's greenlet/`platform_machine`
     marker gap is macOS-host-specific and does not exist inside Linux
     containers, and prod (AWS→Supabase) must use Alembic anyway, so local
     compose exercising the same path is a feature. `scripts/
     integration_docker.sh` stays as-is (it serves bare-host `pytest -m
     integration` runs, a different use case).
  3. Prod compose has no Postgres container — Supabase is the prod DB (root
     CLAUDE.md stack). Connection goes through Supabase's session pooler
     (port 5432); the transaction pooler breaks asyncpg prepared statements
     (pre-existing Risks entry; `statement_cache_size=0` is the fallback).
  4. Prod publishes NO ports: the bot long-polls Telegram outbound and is
     the only client of the api, reached over the internal compose network.
     `X-Internal-Token` remains the auth layer, but not exposing the api
     publicly at all is strictly better on a client-serving AWS box.
  5. Secrets stay runtime-only: `.dockerignore` excludes `.env*`; compose
     injects env via `env_file: .env` (pydantic-settings reads real env vars
     before any `.env` file, so the baked-in absence is harmless). `.env*`
     itself untouched per root CLAUDE.md's do-not-edit list.
  6. Bot has no healthcheck endpoint (polling process, no server) —
     `depends_on: api: condition: service_healthy` + `restart:
     unless-stopped` is the V1 liveness story; a real bot healthcheck is
     V2 territory.
- D42 (plan extension, 2026-07-18): added M6/U6.1 — CD flow (GitHub
  Actions → GHCR → EC2 `docker compose pull && up -d` on merge to master).
  Decisions locked up front so the implementing session only executes:
  1. Env contract stays ONE `.env` per machine (laptop project root; server
     `/opt/bot/.env`, hand-written once, chmod 600). NO `.env.dev`/
     `.env.prod` files in the repo — the dev/prod split is which compose
     file runs, plus per-machine `.env` values. Documented for humans in
     README "Environments & .env" (added same session); root CLAUDE.md
     Environment section points there.
  2. TWO Telegram bots (BotFather): dev token in the laptop `.env`, prod
     token only on the server — Telegram long polling delivers each update
     to exactly one client per token, so sharing one token between laptop
     and server makes messages randomly disappear. Rejected: one shared
     token (the "bot running in two places" pitfall).
  3. Prod compose image becomes `${CASHFLOW_IMAGE:-cashflow:prod}` with
     `build: .` kept: laptop default builds locally (U4.3a behavior
     unchanged), server overrides via one `.env` line to the GHCR image
     (compose reads `.env` for `${...}` interpolation). Image name must be
     lowercase (`ghcr.io/edgar-84/cashflow`) — GHCR rejects uppercase.
  4. Every deploy re-runs the one-shot `migrate` service; `alembic upgrade
     head` is idempotent, so schema changes merged to master apply
     automatically — no separate migration step in the pipeline.
  5. Rollback = image tags: each deploy pushes `:latest` + `:<sha>`; on the
     server, pin the sha in the compose file (or `git revert` on master and
     let CD redeploy).
  6. Server bootstrap (EC2 instance, docker install, GHCR read-only PAT
     login, `/opt/bot/` layout) is a manual, README-documented one-time
     procedure — not automated in V1.
  Sequenced after M5 (U5.1 e2e smoke) although the only hard dependency is
  U4.3a: the pipeline should only ever auto-deploy a smoke-tested master.
- D41 (U4.3a): implementation notes on top of D40, no design changes.
  uv pinned to 0.11.28 in the Dockerfile builder stage (`COPY --from=
  ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.11.28`, matching the host version) with
  `UV_PYTHON_DOWNLOADS=0` (use the image's CPython) and `--no-install-project`
  (flat layout, no build-system — only deps go in the venv; app code is
  copied separately for layer caching). Compose healthchecks hit `/health`
  via `python -c "urllib.request.urlopen(...)"` because `python:3.13-slim`
  ships no curl/wget (and installing one just for a healthcheck bloats the
  image). Local compose also pins the bot's `DATABASE_URL` to the `db`
  service: the value is unused (bot has zero DB imports) but required by
  `config.Settings`, and pinning keeps the local stack independent of
  whatever `DATABASE_URL` the host `.env` holds. `docs/` (minus
  `docs/plans/`) is left in the image; `tests/`, `scripts/`, caches and
  `.git*`/`.env*` are dockerignored. Review follow-up (same session): all
  `build: .` services now also declare a shared `image:` tag
  (`cashflow:local` / `cashflow:prod`) — bare `build: .` made compose tag
  three per-service images from the one build, contradicting D40's
  one-image design; with the shared tag one image is built and reused.
- D40 (U4.3b): `cmd_list_expenses` is a plain `Command("expenses")` handler with
  no FSM state at all — `client.list_expenses()` already returns only the
  caller's account's expenses (backend-side scoping, `api/expenses.py`,
  unchanged), so the bot side needs no own_only/account filtering, matching
  bot/CLAUDE.md's "zero business logic" rule. `_format_expenses_list` reuses
  `_format_amount` (D39) rather than introducing new money-formatting code.
  Registered in `create_router()` right after `cmd_add_expense`/before the
  per-state catch-alls (`on_amount_entered`/`on_comment_entered`), the same
  position that kept `/cancel` reachable in D39 — `/expenses` has no
  `StateFilter`, so it matches regardless of FSM state and is dispatched
  before those catch-alls can shadow it (locked in by a new real-`Dispatcher`
  regression test, `test_expenses_command_reaches_list_handler_not_amount_catchall`,
  same pattern as D39's two `/cancel` tests).
  Reviewed by the reviewer subagent same session (APPROVE — no BLOCKERs).
  Two WARNs fixed same session: (1) an unbounded expense list could produce a
  message over Telegram's 4096-char limit and raise an uncaught
  `TelegramBadRequest`, violating bot/CLAUDE.md's "never a raw traceback" rule
  — fixed with `_MAX_EXPENSES_SHOWN = 30` (list truncated, "...and N more not
  shown." appended) and `_MAX_COMMENT_CHARS = 100` (long comments truncated
  with "…"), covered by `test_list_expenses_truncates_long_list_and_long_comments`;
  (2) no real-dispatch regression test existed proving `/expenses` isn't
  shadowed the way `/cancel` was in D39 — added, see above. Two items flagged,
  not fixed (out of this unit's AC, pre-existing/backend-side): `/expenses`
  (like pre-existing `/add`) has no `StateFilter`, so sending it mid-FSM
  doesn't clear state — the FSM stays parked and the user's next plain-text
  message gets misinterpreted by whatever catch-all handler owns that state;
  same pre-existing pattern as `/add`, not newly introduced by this unit.
  `repositories/base.py`'s generic `list()` has no `ORDER BY`, so `/expenses`
  display order is whatever Postgres/asyncpg returns — no bot-side or
  backend-side sort exists yet; flag for a future unit if newest-first display
  is wanted (would need a repo-level change, out of bot/ scope).

- D43 (U4.4): "handlers/categories + tags" split into U4.4 (categories only)
  and U4.4b (tags, deferred), same class of split as D39/D40. Unlike D39's
  list-view split, no contingency note pre-authorized this in the unit list —
  the split was made against task-methodology's hard budget criteria (≤5
  changed files, ≤~300 diff lines) directly: full CRUD (list/add/rename/
  delete) for two resources plus their tests would have touched bot/states.py,
  two new handler modules, bot/bot.py, two new test files, and tests/README.md
  in one commit — 7 files, well over budget — for what is a mechanical
  near-duplicate between categories and tags (same shape: a `name`-only
  entity). Splitting by resource keeps each unit at 5 files and lets U4.4b
  reuse this unit's design decisions (states/handler/test shape) without
  re-deciding them. Rejected: splitting by CRUD verb (e.g. list+add in one
  unit, rename+delete in another) — would cut across a single resource's
  natural cohesion and double the number of Protocol/router/keyboard-reuse
  decisions instead of halving them. Numbered D43, not D41, to avoid
  colliding with D41 (U4.3a) — this unit's branch diverged from master
  before U4.3a/U4.3b/D40–D42 landed there; merged back in and renumbered
  post-hoc rather than re-deriving the ID from a stale branch state.
  Reviewed by the reviewer subagent same session (APPROVE — no BLOCKERs).
  One WARN fixed same session: this decision-log entry was missing (unit
  checkbox text and STATE referenced the decision before the entry existed).
  Three NITs flagged, not fixed (pre-existing pattern, same as D40/U4.3b): (1)
  `cmd_add_category`/`cmd_rename_category`/`cmd_delete_category` have no
  `StateFilter`, so invoking one mid-flow silently abandons the prior FSM
  state instead of being rejected — same gap as `/add`/`/expenses` (D40); (2)
  `on_rename_category_name_entered`'s `UUID(data["rename_target_id"])` has no
  guard for a missing key — low risk, the FSM always sets it immediately
  beforehand; (3) `cmd_rename_category`/`cmd_delete_category` don't call
  `state.clear()` on a `list_categories()` failure — harmless today since
  no new state has been set yet at that point.
- D44 (U4.4b): mechanical mirror of U4.4/D43 for tags, one deliberate
  deviation: `_error_message()` has no 409 "still in use" branch. Category
  delete is `ON DELETE RESTRICT` (D5) so a 409 is reachable; tag delete is
  `ON DELETE CASCADE` and tag names have no per-account unique constraint
  (D19, services/tag_service.py docstring), so the backend can never return
  409 for tag create/delete — a 409 branch would be dead code. Added a
  `test_delete_tag_permission_denied_shows_friendly_message` case instead
  (categories' equivalent unit had no delete-permission test, only
  delete-conflict; tags needed delete error coverage from somewhere since
  conflict isn't reachable). Not a contract change — same three same-shape
  gaps as D43's NITs apply here too (no `StateFilter` on the `cmd_add_tag`/
  `cmd_rename_tag`/`cmd_delete_tag` entry points, no key-guard on
  `UUID(data["rename_target_id"])`, no `state.clear()` on a `list_tags()`
  failure) — not re-flagging individually, same pre-existing pattern,
  fix once for both resources if ever addressed.

- D45 (U4.5): "handlers/budgets + statistics rendering" scoped to read-only
  rendering only, no FSM, no budget-plan CRUD commands in the bot — unlike
  D43's "categories + tags" split, this unit's own AC only ever said
  "rendering tests on fixed API responses (progress bars, totals formatted
  from minor units)", never "add/rename/delete" (contrast U4.4's AC wording).
  Budget-plan create/update/delete stay reachable via the API only for V1
  (and thus by a future Mini App unchanged, per root CLAUDE.md's HTTP-only
  bot rule) — reasonable given budget plans are low-frequency, set-up-once
  data, unlike categories/tags. `bot/handlers/budgets.py` — `cmd_list_budgets`
  (`/budgets`): fetches `list_budget_plans()` + `list_categories()` (for
  name resolution — `BudgetPlanResponse`/`BudgetProgress` only carry
  `category_id`, D34), then one `get_budget_plan_progress()` call per plan
  to render a 10-cell text progress bar + spent/limit formatted from minor
  units + an exceeded/over-threshold warning line. `bot/handlers/statistics.py`
  — `cmd_statistics` (`/statistics`): single command rendering
  `statistics_by_period`/`by_category`/`by_tag` totals (current-month only,
  D35), category/tag names resolved the same way, breakdowns sorted by total
  descending, sections omitted when empty. Both modules duplicate a private
  `_format_amount`/`_BACKEND_UNREACHABLE` (now a 3rd/4th copy) rather than
  extracting a shared `bot/formatting.py` — same deliberate small-duplication
  precedent as D34/D35's `_current_month_bounds`, flagged not fixed by the
  reviewer subagent (APPROVE). Reviewer also flagged, not fixed: (1) the
  per-plan `get_budget_plan_progress` N+1 pattern in `cmd_list_budgets` —
  same class of accepted tradeoff as D36's two extra `budget_plan_repo` round
  trips per expense-create, a candidate for a `GET /budgets?with_progress=true`
  backend endpoint if the plan list ever grows large; (2) `_render_progress_bar`'s
  `round()` uses Python's banker's-rounding, giving a cosmetic asymmetric bias
  exactly at a bar cell's .5 boundary (e.g. `fill_pct=25.0` rounds its 2.5-cell
  fill down to 2, `75.0` rounds 7.5 up to 8) — the adjacent `{fill_pct:.0f}%`
  text label is unaffected and stays numerically correct. `bot/bot.py` wires
  both new routers (mechanical, no `StateFilter`/catch-all ordering concerns
  since neither router registers per-state text handlers). verify.sh green
  (347 non-integration tests: 331 + 16 new); this unit touches no
  repository/DB code, so the pre-existing integration suite wasn't re-run.


## Deferred decisions (tracked, not forgotten)
- Account Pydantic model: intentionally absent in V1. Accounts are seeded
  via docs/seed.sql. Trigger to add: first service needing a typed account
  row, or V2 self-registration. See models/CLAUDE.md.
- Bot allowlist in .env: replace with users-table lookup before building
  the admin panel. See root CLAUDE.md → Out of scope.
